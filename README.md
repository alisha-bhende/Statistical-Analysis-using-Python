This analysis explores relationships between different psychological and behavioral variables such as stress, self-esteem, life satisfaction, smoking habits, and education levels using various statistical methods.

The project aims to answer the following research questions using statistical tests and visualizations:
**What is the relationship between stress and self-esteem?**
- Statistical Test: Pearsonâ€™s Correlation
- Findings: A statistically significant negative correlation (-0.58) between stress and self-esteem, indicating that higher stress is associated with lower self-esteem.

**How well do stress and optimism predict life satisfaction?**
- Statistical Test: Multiple Linear Regression
- Findings:
Stress negatively impacts life satisfaction (-0.42 coefficient).
Optimism positively impacts life satisfaction (+0.52 coefficient).
The model suggests that people with higher optimism tend to have higher life satisfaction, while increased stress reduces satisfaction.

**Is there a link between smoking status and age group?**
- Statistical Test: Chi-Square Test
- Findings: A statistically significant association (p = 0.014) between smoking habits and age groups, meaning smoking behavior varies by age.

**Is there a significant difference in optimism scores between smokers and non-smokers?**
- Statistical Test: T-test
- Findings: No statistically significant difference (p = 0.071) in optimism levels between smokers and non-smokers.

**Does life satisfaction differ significantly across education levels?**
- Statistical Test: ANOVA
- Findings: A significant difference (p = 0.006) in life satisfaction across education levels, suggesting that educational background influences life satisfaction.
